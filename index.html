    <p>Hello, my name is Robert Cavalero.  I was born and raised in Seattle, Wa.  I have three children, two boys and a girl.  I am currently a student in the UW Coding Boot Camp for Full Stack Web Development. </p>
    
    <p>When I'm not working or going to school you can usually find me at the movies, playing a round of golf, playing Pai Gow or cooking for friends and family.  I consider myself a foodie and am always wanting to try new recipes and restaurants.  I once thought of becoming a chef and attended culinary arts school for a year. I didn't end up pursuing that as a career but instead found myself fascinated by technology and have been mostly working technology related jobs ever since.</p>
